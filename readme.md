#PTE Bot (Alpha)

Reviewing is boring and sometimes the queue of string to approve can be very long.

Go to [ptebot.mte90.net](http://ptebot.mte90.net) and insert your email to receive a random plugin 1, 2 or 3 times a week that need an approval of the strings.

##How Works

Every day check the frequency for every PTE subscribed and pick a random plugin what have strings not approved.  
Actually do a scraping from the HTML because GlotPress don't have a REST API so this pick 1 plugin from a list of 20 plugins.
